Installing VisualScript is simple. 
Download the latest release from here:
https://github.com/Bruceli-iscool/VisualScript/releases/tag/1.0.1
Then extract the zip file.
Your done!
To code VisualScript all you need is notepad.
We, however, prefer Visual Studio Code. 
To start create a file with an .vs extension.
Then code in it. 
More about that in later chapters.
Then find the VisualScript executable.
Enter the path to your code.
It should run.
Also, you can use built in commands for help.
